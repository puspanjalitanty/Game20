# Game20
It is a simple game in which you play with the program and whoever says 20, wins.

Rules:
1. The game always starts with 1.
2. The input has to be consecutive numbers (maximum 3 and minimum 1).
3. You have start from where the program left.
4. The one who gets to say 20 is the winner.

Example:

Player 1 : 1 2 
Program : 3 4
Player 1 : 5 6 7
Program : 8
Player 1 : 9
Program : 10 11 12
Player 1 : 13 14
Program : 15 16
Player 1 : 17
Program : 18 19 20

Since the program says 20, it wins the game.
